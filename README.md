# Enhanced Sorting

_Multiplayer Compatible_

This mod rewrites the base game's "sort inventory" function to not accidentally delete items when the inventory has filtered slots. The mod has no noticeable effect if the inventory being sorted has no sorted slots.

You can create filtered slots with a mod like [Inventory Filters](https://ficsit.app/mod/InventoryFilters).
